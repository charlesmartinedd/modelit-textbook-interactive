            <img src="forest.jpg" alt="A vibrant forest ecosystem illustrating interconnected systems" style="width:100%; height:auto;">
            <p>You can't unsee it now. Everything is connected. What will you do with this knowledge?</p>
            <p>Imagine you're walking through a forest. As you step on the soft earth, you hear the rustle of leaves, smell the fresh scent of pine, and feel the cool breeze on your skin. Suddenly, a squirrel darts across the path, chasing after an acorn. You stop and think — how is everything around me connected?</p>
            <p>Welcome to the world of systems thinking. This way of seeing the world helps us understand how different parts of a system — like the forest — work together in harmony.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Concepts of Systems Thinking</h2>
            <ul class="key-concepts">
                <li>
                    <h3>1. Interconnectedness</h3>
                    <p>Everything in a system is linked. Just like how the squirrel relies on the acorn for food, and the tree relies on the squirrel to spread its seeds.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>2. Feedback Loops</h3>
                    <p>These are cycles where the output of a system feeds back into it. For example, when you exercise, your body sweats to cool down.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>3. Boundaries</h3>
                    <p>Every system has limits. Understanding where a system starts and ends helps us define what we're studying.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>4. Emergence</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes, new properties or behaviors appear when different parts of a system interact, making a forest different from just a collection of trees.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Systems Thinking in Action</h2>
            <p>Let's look at a real-world example: a school cafeteria. Imagine you're planning a new lunch menu. A systems thinker would consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> How does the food impact students' health and energy levels?</li>
                <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Where does the food come from? Is it sourced sustainably?</li>
                <li><strong>Budget:</strong> How much does the food cost? Is it affordable for the school?</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> How do students feel about the food? Are there ways to improve the menu based on their feedback?</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Connections and Reflections</h2>
            <p>Systems thinking helps us connect topics, showing how they influence each other. For example, in previous chapters, we've explored ecosystems and technology.</p>
            <p>By becoming a systems thinker, you can see the world in a new way. So, what will you do with this knowledge?</p>
