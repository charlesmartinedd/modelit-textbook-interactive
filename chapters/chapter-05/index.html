            <h2>Hook</h2>
            <p>Every 7 years, you have an almost completely new body. How does 'you' stay you? It sounds like magic, but it's all about the incredible systems that make up the human body. Let's explore how your body keeps you uniquely you, even as most of your cells are replaced over time.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Opening Story/Scenario</h2>
            <p>Imagine you're a detective in the city of You. Your mission is to understand how the city functions smoothly, despite constant changes. Buildings are renovated, streets repaved, and people come and go. Yet, the city remains unmistakably itself. Just like this city, your body is a bustling metropolis of cells, working together as a complex system to keep you alive and well. Let's dive into the systems at play and discover their secrets.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Section 1: The Body's Building Blocks: Cells and Systems</h2>
            <p>Your body is made up of trillions of tiny units called cells. Each type of cell has a specific job, much like different workers in a city. These cells form tissues, and tissues form organs. Organs work together in systems to keep your body functioning.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> A system is a group of parts that work together as a whole. In the human body, systems like the circulatory, respiratory, and digestive systems keep you alive by performing specialized functions.</p>
            <p>Think about how the circulatory system is like a delivery service, transporting oxygen and nutrients to cells and removing waste. Meanwhile, the respiratory system acts like the city's air supply, bringing in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. These systems interact seamlessly, much like how departments in a city government work together for the city's well-being.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Section 2: Communication and Control: The Nervous and Endocrine Systems</h2>
            <p>The nervous and endocrine systems are the body's communication networks. The nervous system uses electrical signals to send messages rapidly, like an express train zipping through the city. Meanwhile, the endocrine system sends chemical signals (hormones) through the bloodstream, like mailing letters.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Systems thinking involves understanding how parts of a system influence one another within a whole. In the human body, the nervous and endocrine systems must coordinate to respond to changes, such as when you touch something hot or feel stressed.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Section 3: Growth and Repair: The Magic of Regeneration</h2>
            <p>Your body is constantly renewing itself. Some cells, like skin and blood cells, are replaced frequently. Others, like brain cells, last much longer. This process of regeneration helps heal injuries and keep you healthy.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> Regeneration is the process by which cells and tissues renew themselves. It's a crucial part of how your body adapts to changes and maintains its identity over time.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Section 4: The Immune System: Your Body's Defense Mechanism</h2>
            <p>The immune system is your body's defense force, protecting you from invaders like bacteria and viruses. It's like a security team that patrols the city, identifying and neutralizing threats.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Concept:</strong> The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to defend the body against harmful substances. It uses a variety of strategies to keep you safe.</p>
        </section>
        <div class="reflection-questions">
            <h2>Summary and Reflection Questions</h2>
            <p>1. How do the different body systems work together to maintain your health?</p>
            <p>2. What role does the immune system play in protecting your body from harm?</p>
            <p>3. How do cells regenerate, and why is this process important for your body's function?</p>
            <p>4. In what ways do the nervous and endocrine systems communicate to keep your body balanced?</p>
